#Douglaston Yacht Squadron SPA

##Description

This application is intended to be a showcase page for the Douglaston Yacht Squadron. It will provide to the visitor a series of photographs and short videos and documentaries that will hopefully convey the experience of belonging to and participating in the fleet. The squadron page will provide some basic contact information. It's call to action should be Join the Fleet or some such notion.

Basic integration with Google Maps, YouTube or Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, a Weather/Tide service, Flickr, and a blog is expected for this application.

This application should probably also mention the Junior Yacht Squadron.

This is meant to be a Node JS application running on Heroku or AWS or another free hosting service. It will have very limited administrative capabilities to allow the posting and removal of blog entries, posting an removing videos and pictures. The application is intended to be Open Source, with its code hosted on Github. It will utilize Bootstrap 3.x.
